      <h2>Our System</h2>
      <p>Lifted Systems was incorporated in 2013 in response to growing demand for product and technology development services.
          We have performed both in-house research and development as well as under contract to a variety of technology companies in Canada.
          Ben Bacque’s broad and deep background in semiconductors, computing, communications, and power technologies allows Lifted Systems to address customer problems from an integrated perspective, achieving more optimal solutions by considering the entirety of the problem-space holistically.
      </p>
      <p>Ben Bacque’s undergraduate engineering degree was in the Computer Science option of Engineering Science at the University of TOronto (1995).
        After a two year work term architecting and implementing a shared-bus multiprocessing supercomputer for SemiTech, Inc, JBB returned to complete a M.A.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, focussing on parallel computing.
        In 1990  Ben Bacque joined Motorola Semiconductor performing applications engineering and market and technology development specializing in communications technology.
        In 1997 Ben Bacque co-founded the Broadband Copper Access business unit of Newbridge Networks, developing digital subscriber line and IP TV technologies.
      </p>
      <p>In 2000, Ben Bacque co-founded Tropic Networks to address the explosive growth in bandwidth using reconfigurable optical technology. Serving a variety of roles at Tropic, from VP Product Line Management, VP R+D, and CTO until Tropic’s acquisition by Alcatel-Lucent in 2007.
        Ben Bacque shepherded the product, team, and technology post-acquisition until late 2009, when Lifted Systems was formed.
        The Tropic technology continues to live on within the ALcatel-Lucent product line as the 1830 DWDM platform, selling roughly a billion euros a year to global markets.
        Lifted Systems Limited has been performing research, product development and technology consulting to a variety of customers since that time.
